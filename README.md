# Multi Cycle RISC Processor

Run the `assembler.py` python file. By default it has `BubbleSortMIPS.txt` file opened which contains the bubble sort code in our MIPS-like instructions. Change if needed.

The assembler output has two components:
- the operands of each instruction along with their opcode, for example: `['R1', '9(R0)'] 19`
- the 32 bit instructions that can be copied to the initializations in the `InsMem` module.

The testbench along with required modules are provided, use the code within in any online compiler or suitable editor.
